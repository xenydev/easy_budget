# Easy budget

Easy budget is a flutter app made by me for learning proposes.

## About

Is a Flutter app where you can add/update/delete your expenses and see the total of it. It uses riverpod for state management, freezed and sembast for local data storage.

The app has state management, local store management (crud),app icon plus splash screen, routing, snackbars for errors and completed actions, error catching and theming.

I'm new at flutter but I think the code is kinda well written and organized be free to use it if you want to.
